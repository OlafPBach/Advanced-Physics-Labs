\section{Introduction}
\begin{center}
\normalsize{This lab was very difficult for me as i had no clue how to properly replicate the first unfiltered graph. No matter what I did I never got a square wave, and instead i kept getting spikes. Nonetheless, my filtered graph came out very nice despite not having a good reference.}

\section{Setup}

\end{center}

\begin{noindent}
\normalsize{The breadboard was setup as a low pass filter. The signal coming from the d9 pin went throught a resistor and then through a capacitor then to ground. The A0 pin is connected in between the resistor and the capacitor and gives a filtered version of the original source.}

\section{Arduino Code}
\begin{noindent}
\normalsize{The Arduino code just generates a tone and records the time.\\[2pt]}

\section{Data}
\begin{noindent}
\normalsize{I ran the tone sequence without a filter and then with a filter. I then put both data points onto one graph where the raw signal is blue and the filtered signal is red. My biggest issue is that I couldn't figure out how to make the raw signal look good so instead it just looks like lines, apologies for that.}

\normalsize{The filter is working based on how the tone signal works. In the raw signal the value is either zero or the highest. However in a the filtered signal it lowers the peaks and raises the troughs. As well as the shape goes from a square wave (ideally) to a sort of sine wave.}
